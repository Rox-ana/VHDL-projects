It is a very simple CPU containing:
- 4 registers
- a PC register 
- an IR register
- an ALU with the ability to add and subtract
- a ROM
- the ability to act on 4 instructions: load,add,sub, and jump not zero.
It is written in VHDL.
Three programs where put into it for implementation:
First: five times six (multiplication of two numbers)
Second: replacing the amonut of two registers with one another
Third: five to the power of two

Rom was initialized by the code for the programs.
